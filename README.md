Chat with PDF AI - README
Overview
The Chat with PDF AI project is an interactive AI-powered tool that enables users to upload PDFs and extract insights using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By embedding the contents of uploaded PDFs into a vector database, the tool allows users to query documents with natural language and receive accurate, contextually relevant responses.

Features
PDF Upload and Processing: Supports single or multiple PDF files for seamless document analysis.
Embeddings Creation: Utilizes OpenAI embeddings to convert document content into a vectorized format for enhanced querying capabilities.
Vector Database: Stores document embeddings in FAISS for efficient similarity-based retrieval.
Question-Answering: Leverages embedded vectors to provide precise responses to user queries.
Interactive Interface: Built using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for document uploads and querying.
Key Components
PDF Processing:

Documents are parsed using PyPDFLoader to extract text efficiently.
Content is split into manageable chunks for embedding.
Text Embedding:

Embeddings are generated using OpenAIEmbeddings with support for GPT-4.
Chunked text is embedded into vector representations for retrieval.
Vector Store:

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is used as the backend for vector storage and similarity search.
Streamlit Integration:

The tool is deployed with a user-friendly interface that allows PDF uploads, embedding initiation, and query execution.
